note over client,AS:MAC = HMAC(K_client, m_client)\nMAC = HMAC(K_RS, HMAC(MAC, m_RS))
note right of client:Client:\n• is registered at the AS as a confidential client and has a client secret
note right of RS:RS:\n• is registered at the AS as a confidential client and has a client secret
client->AS:1. authorization grant
AS->AS:2. AS:\n a) issues an opaque access token using a high entropy nonce data string\n b) maps the corresponding client secrets to the issued token and stores the token data in a database
client<-AS:3. access token
client->client:4. Client:\n• generates the pocop-jwt with a payload including the access token, issuer and a timestamp 
note right of client:The pocop-jwt is generated as:\npocop-jwt = header || "." || payload || "." || signature\nwhere\nheader = base64url encoded {"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}\npayload = base64url encoded {"token":access token,"iss":client name,"ts":timestamp}\nsignature = base64url encoded HMAC-SHA256(K_client, m_client)\nwhere\nm_client = header || "." || payload\nK_client = SHA256(client secret)
client->RS:5. pocop-jwt
RS->RS:6. RS:\n• generates the next pocop-jwt with a compound payload
note right of RS:• a new required claim {"iss":client name,"ts":timestamp} must be added to the previous pocop-jwt\n   payload as a nested object to form a new compound payload\n• the nested object may contain additional optional claims e.g., "resource_id", "resource_scopes"
note right of RS:The pocop-jwt is generated as:\npocop-jwt = header || "." || payload || "." || signature\nwhere\nheader = previous pocop-jwt header\npayload = base64url encoded [previous pocop-jwt payload(pocop-jwt payload)]\nsignature = base64url encoded HMAC-SHA256(K_RS, HMAC-SHA256(MAC, m_RS))\nwhere\npocop-jwt payload = {"iss":client name,"ts":timestamp}\nm_RS = header || "." || payload\nK_RS = SHA256(client secret)\nMAC = base64url decoded previous pocop-jwt signature
RS->AS:7. pocop-jwt
note right of RS:RS sends the pocop-jwt in the Authorization header\nto authenticate itself to the AS introspection endpoint
AS->AS:8. AS:\n a) looks up the access token data using the token claim value from the pocop-jwt, and checks the token state\n b) generates a pocop-jwt replica using the pocop-jwt payload data, token data and corresponding client secrets\n c) compares the pocop-jwt replica signature with the pocop-jwt signature, they are equal,\n     the chronological record of all the possessors of the POCOP token and the changes have been verified,\n     the AS validates the ts (timestamp) claim values from the pocop-jwt, if valid,\n     the AS may return the access token introspection response
RS<-AS:9. access token introspection response
RS->RS:10. verifies the access token introspection response, if true,\n   the RS may return the protected resource
client<-RS:21. protected resource
